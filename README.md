# Ants
A program somewhat emulating the formation of pheromone paths as seen in nature. It is by no means finished, and honestly, 
It never will be. I am sick of ants, simulated or not. The current approach makes it look like it's working, but it's really not.
I could probably get it working with enough time, but I've moved on. 
## Screenshots
Here are a few screenshots of the two major versions.
### Current version (more ants can be simulated, due to tiled approach)

### Old version (time complexity incredibly high)
